            Hello gyes in this readme file , i mention about the Cites in Bangladesh which is near to any river. With this information we can easily observe that in this cites flood might be come if the River level is increases due to Rainfall. so i am going to list down those cites name with their local River name:

1.Dhaka: Dhaka, the capital and largest city of Bangladesh, is situated along the banks of the Buriganga River, which is a distributary of the Ganges.

2.Chittagong (Chattogram): Chittagong, the second-largest city, is located along the Karnaphuli River, which flows into the Bay of Bengal.

3.Rajshahi: Rajshahi is situated along the banks of the Padma River, one of the major rivers of Bangladesh.

4.Barisal: Barisal, also known as the 'Venice of the East,' is located on the banks of the Kirtankhola River.

5.Khulna: Khulna is situated near the Rupsha River and the adjacent Sundarbans mangrove forest.

6.Narayanganj: Narayanganj is located on the banks of the Shitalakshya River, a distributary of the Brahmaputra.

7.Mymensingh: Mymensingh is situated on the Brahmaputra River's right bank.

8.Sylhet: Sylhet, known for its scenic beauty, is near the Surma River and its tributaries.

9.Comilla (Cumilla): Comilla is close to the Gumti River.

10.Bogra: Bogra is near the Karatoya River, a significant river in northern Bangladesh.

I am going to collect the River Dischage level in m³/s unit for each city by using Flood Api and that API link is:-https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/flood-api

    Question:-What actually River Discharge Means and how it help us in Flood Forecatsig ?
            =River discharge refers to the volume of water flowing through a river or stream at a specific point over a given period of time, typically measured              in cubic meters per second (m³/s) or cubic feet per second (cfs). It provides essential information for flood forecasting and hydrological                       analysis. Here's what river discharge data tells us and how it aids in flood forecasting:

                   1.Flow Rate: River discharge quantifies the flow rate of a river, which is the amount of water passing a specific point in the river per unit                      of time. This data is crucial for understanding the volume of water moving downstream.

                   2.Hydrological Conditions: River discharge data helps hydrologists and meteorologists understand the current hydrological conditions of a                          river. It indicates whether the river is in a normal, low-flow, or high-flow state.

                   3.Rising or Falling Waters: Monitoring changes in river discharge over time can indicate whether the water level is rising (indicating a                           potential flood) or falling. Sudden and significant increases in discharge can be a warning sign of imminent flooding.



	NOTE:- River Dischare column Represent Daily river discharge rate in m³/s.
